Singleton

Step 1: Create a class to turned into the singleton class.
Step 2: Specify all the class data members (variables).
Step 3: Specify all the class operations or methods.
Step 4: create a static member of the class to store the very first instance of the class to be created.
Step 5: Within and at the end of the constructor of the class, assign the static property (created in step 4) a value, which values is an instance of the class (singleton class)
Step 6: Check for whether there exists any created instance of the singleton class. if there is an instance of the current class already created, then return that instance.
Step 7: Test for whether the singleton class works as expected. The class creates only one instance irrespective of how many times it is instantiated.
